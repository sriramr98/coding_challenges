# Coding Challenges

This repo contains my implementations of common tools we use day to day, but don't understand how they work under the hood. This is an attempt to recreate those tools while learning imporving my skills as a software engineer

# Tools 
* wc -> A tool to print stats about files
  * Original Tool -> [link](https://linux.die.net/man/1/wc)
  * My Replica -> [link](https://github.com/sriramr98/coding_challenges/tree/main/ccwc)
